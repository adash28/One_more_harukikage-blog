# My First Stable Diffusion Experiments

In this post, I share my initial explorations with Stable Diffusion and what I've learned about prompt engineering.

## Getting Started

Stable Diffusion has opened up incredible possibilities for AI-generated art...

## Key Learnings

1. **Prompt Engineering Matters**: The quality of your prompts directly impacts results
2. **Negative Prompts**: Essential for avoiding unwanted elements
3. **Sampling Steps**: Balance between quality and generation time

## Example Prompts

```
Positive: "A serene mountain landscape at sunset, highly detailed, 8k, professional photography"
Negative: "blurry, low quality, distorted"
```

## Results and Reflections

The generated images exceeded my expectations in terms of composition and artistic quality...
